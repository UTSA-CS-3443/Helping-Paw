# Helping-Paw

**Helping Paw** is an application designed to assist you in planning your day according to your preferred time allocation and daily routine. What sets Helping Paw apart is its unique emphasis on promoting mental health and adapting to the user's lifestyle. This stress-free planner application offers a positive helping hand to help users realistically achieve their goals.

## Features

- **Guidance from Cat Companions:** Throughout the application, a cat in the right corner provides special instructions, guidance, and encouragement. Messages like "You're doing great!" and "Productivity master!" are designed to create a positive and supportive atmosphere.

- **OptionsView:** Accessed through the MainView, users can customize their experience by choosing themes from a pastel variety pack. Additionally, users can select one of three trusty helping paw agents—Phil, Ed, and Salem—to guide them through their tasks.

- **PlannerView:** This view displays tasks in three list views—Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. Users can edit tasks and start timers from this centralized hub.

- **Task Editing:** By clicking the "Edit Task" button, users enter a view where they can add, edit, or delete tasks. Helping lab agents guide users to fill in the task name and select the corresponding time of day. Tasks are displayed in a list view categorized by Morning, Afternoon, and Evening.

- **TimerView:** Users can start a task by clicking the "Start a Timer" button in the PlannerView. This view displays the selected task underneath a circular progression bar. Users can input the time in minutes and monitor progress visually. Options to pause or mark a task as done are also available.

- **Task Completion:** After completing a task, it is removed from the tasks list view, and the next task based on the time of day and priority appears in the task name textbox.

## Code Quality

Our code is free of known bugs, and each team member made significant contributions to the project. For instance, Andrea focused on setting up the timer and progression bar, Bianca worked on the model for cats and task systems, while Litzy participated in setting up various model and view components for the program.
